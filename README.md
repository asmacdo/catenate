All the resources and conText a new conScript needs, smushed together into a single repository.

## Welcome

Welcome to the [Center for Open Neuroscience](https://centerforopenneuroscience.org/), where we are working together to make Neuroscience a better science!

We do that by developing standards, workflows, tools, and automation to improve the effieniency, transparency, and reproducibility of the next generation of Neuroscience.

## Employees

If you are a new employee of the Center for Open Neuroscience, see [con/boarding](conboarding.md).

## The Ecosystem

There are a LOT of things to know!
We have a handy [definitions page](definitions.md), which briefly introduces acronyms, projects, and more with links.

## The Vision

Here are a few resources that can help to understand how the projects fit together into the Open Neuroscience ecosystem.

[Intro slides](https://datasets.datalad.org/centerforopenneuroscience/talks/2022-nih-compcore.html#/)

[5 Steps to More Reproducible Neuroimaging Research](https://www.repronim.org/5steps)
: High level of how many of the ReproNim projects fit together into a Reproducibility-friendly workflow.

    1. Study Design
    2. Data Collection
    3. Data Processing
    4. Statistical Analysis
    5. Publication


[Dartmouth neuroimaging fundamentals](https://dartbrains.org/content/intro.html)
: Course that covers basic MRI physics, and high level explanations of programming, data analysis, and more!

[(private) ReproNim grant 2021 drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AbpaqrCnInU-0V7KCxIn0RdG7578JrzI?ths=true)
: All the drafts and responses of the 2021 ReproNim Grant.

[Open is not enough. Letâ€™s take the next step: an integrated, community-driven computing platform for neuroscience](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2012.00022/full)
: note written in 2012

[Promoting an open research culture](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aab2374)

Dianne Patterson's [Neuroimaging Core Docs](https://neuroimaging-core-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for the University of Arizona group is an excellent resource that covers usage of many open source Neuroimaging tools for BIDS data.
